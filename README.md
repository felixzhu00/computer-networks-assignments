# Computer Networks - Assignments Overview

This repository serves as an index for the "Computer Networks" assignment series. Below is an overview of each assignment:

## [Assignment 1: Network Basics and Socket Programming](Assignment1/README.md)
Assignment 1 covers the fundamentals of computer networks and socket programming. The focus is on understanding how data is transmitted across networks and how to establish communication between different systems using sockets. Practical exercises involve creating simple client-server applications.

## [Assignment 2: Advanced Socket Programming and Protocols](Assignment2/README.md)
Assignment 2 delves deeper into socket programming and explores various network protocols. This assignment involves implementing more complex client-server applications and understanding TCP/IP, UDP, and HTTP. Emphasis is placed on protocol-specific behaviors and handling data transmission efficiently.

## [Assignment 3: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Ping Application](Assignment3/README.md)
Assignment 3 provides a better understanding of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) by developing a Ping application. This assignment involves sending ICMP request and reply messages to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time (RTT). It also includes analyzing packet loss and summarizing the statistics of the pinging session.
